# AndroidAppCrashFlowChart

[![Android Weekly](http://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Weekly-%23171-2CB3E5.svg?style=flat)](http://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-171)

A flow chart to help the modern Android dev solve crashes. This originally was just going to be a one off project, but I have seen an outpouring of support from those who wish to build off this. This is what open source is all about, collaboration.  

##### How to contribute?

1. Import the xml android_app_crash_flow_chart.xml file into [draw.io][1].
2. Make your changes and save the flow chart as an XML file.
3. Submit a PR here so the entire Android community can benefit.
